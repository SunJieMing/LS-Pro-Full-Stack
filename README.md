## Homework

Build a full-stack application!  Use `create-react-app` with `axios` to build a client that can communicate with your server.
On your server be sure to install `cors`, `body-parser`, and `mongoose`.
If you don't have MongoDB be sure to install it and start its server using `mongod`.
Your client will communicate with your node server and your node server will communicate with the client and the database server.
Good luck and have fun!
